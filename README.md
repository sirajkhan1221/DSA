**Daily DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) Learning Log**

Welcome to my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Learning Journey**! Here, I keep a daily record of the topics I study, problems I solve, and my reflections on what I've learned.

> **Why this log?** 🤔  
> - 💡 **To track my progress** over time.  
> - 🔍 **To solidify my understanding** of DSA concepts by writing them down.  
> - 🌱 **To showcase my learning process** and dedication to improving my skills.

## Overview 🔎
Here, I outline my **overall goals** and **focus areas** for my DSA studies:

- **Goal #1** 🏆: Understand fundamental Data Structures (Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, etc.).
- **Goal #2** 🏆: Master essential Algorithms (Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, Greedy, etc.).
- **Goal #3** 🏆: Solve practice problems regularly to build intuition and confidence.

### Day 1 - 2025-01-07 📝
**Topic(s) Covered**:
- ✨ Introduction to Big O notation  
- ✨ Basic complexity analysis for simple algorithms (O(n), O(n^2))

**Key Takeaways**:
- ✅ Understood how to represent time complexity using Big O.  
- ✅ Learned that constants and lower-order terms are ignored in Big O notation.

**Problems Solved**:
1. **Problem A**: *Brief description of the problem* (🔗 Link if available)  
2. **Problem B**: *Brief description of the problem* (🔗 Link if available)

**Reflections/Challenges**:
- 🤔 Struggled a bit with understanding the difference between O(n) and O(n^2) in practical examples.  
- 🤔 Realized I need more practice with analyzing loops and nested loops.

**Next Steps**:
- 🔭 Solve a few more examples of nested loops to clarify O(n^2).  
- 💻 Move on to Linked Lists tomorrow.
